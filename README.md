# Micropython-Tuner
A rudimentary tuner on the STM32F4DISC1 that detects a note through an analog microphone + preamp, processes the signal using the FFT from the ulab version of numpy, displays the detected note on the staff using the built-in screen, lets you save notes by pressing the button, lets you clear saved notes by holding down the button, and enables you to play saved notes by pressing the touchscreen.
